purpose: To test an array of indexed port

Design has two blocks mod1(master) and mod2(slave) connected in a multipoint link.

Array of index port P1 and P2 are defined with 10 members of an address range
of (0,4). Execution of design is stopped when the index range is exceeded than 
the declared range.
